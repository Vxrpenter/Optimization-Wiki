  <h1>Optimization Wiki</h1>
</div>

## Purpose
This is a small project where I list game optimization tips that I have found somewhere on the internet. I try to make them comprehensive to understand and always give credit to the source the Information came from e.g. Nexusmods, Youtube or Reddit. If you want to contribute too, create an issue in which you state the following two things: The **Game** you want to write for, the **Tinkers** you want to add, thats all.
